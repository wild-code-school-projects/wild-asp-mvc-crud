# wild-asp-mvc-crud
This is the first crud ASP assignment using EF.

## Objective

You will create a CRUD application that allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of articles using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

The Article entity will define three fields:

    A numeric identifier (primary key)
    A title (string)
    Content (text)

Validation Criteria

    The solution is shared via a GitHub repository.
    The Article entity exists and includes the three fields defined in the challenge.
    An ArticleController defines all the methods for a CRUD.
    A view allows interaction with the CRUD through a web interface.
